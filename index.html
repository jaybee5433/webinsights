        <span class="post-date">1 Oct 2024</span>
        <p class="post-description">california has become the first state to enact a law prohibiting public schools from serving foods containing six artificial dyes—Red 40, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Blue 1, Blue 2, and Green 3—due to their association with health and behavior issues in children. Governor Gavin Newsom signed the California School Food Safety Act into law, which will take effect on December 31, 2027. The law aims to promote healthier food options for students by encouraging manufacturers to replace synthetic dyes with natural alternatives, such as carrot or beet juice. This move is part of a broader effort to enhance
             children's health and well-being amid growing concerns over artificial additives​</p>
